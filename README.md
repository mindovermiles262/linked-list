# Linked Lists

The [Odin](http://theodinproject.com) Project's [Linked Lists](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/linked-lists)

Your Task

You will need two classes:

`LinkedList` class, which will represent the full list.
`Node` class, containing a `#value` method and a link to the `#next_node`, set both as nil by default.

Build the following methods in your linked list class:

`#append` adds a new node to the end of the list
`#prepend` adds a new node to the start of the list
`#size` returns the total number of nodes in the list
`#head` returns the first node in the list
`#tail` returns the last node in the list
`#at(index)` returns the node at the given index
`#pop` removes the last element from the list
`#contains?` returns true if the passed in value is in the list and otherwise returns false.
`#find(data)` returns the index of the node containing data, or nil if not found.
`#to_s` represent your LinkedList objects as strings, so you can print them out and preview them in the console. The format should be: `( data ) -> ( data ) -> ( data ) -> nil`
